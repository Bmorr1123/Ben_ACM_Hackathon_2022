# Ben_ACM_Hackathon_2022

Ben Morrison and Ben O'Bryan

This is our submission for the "Childhood Revamped" challenge in the 2022 UAH ACM Hackathon. 
We decided to do snake with a twist. We have a classic snake client that everyone knows and loves, but it is multiplayer.

So have fun and ruin your friendships by ruining their runs!
